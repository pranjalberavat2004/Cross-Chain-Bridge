# Cross-Chain Bridge

## üìå Project Description
Cross-Chain Bridge is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to enable secure and efficient transfer of tokens between different blockchain networks. It simulates the token locking and unlocking mechanism required for cross-chain transactions.

## üåç Project Vision
To create a secure, decentralized, and transparent bridge mechanism that empowers seamless asset transfers across various blockchain ecosystems, fostering greater interoperability and user experience.

## ‚≠ê Key Features
- **Token Locking Mechanism**: Users can lock tokens on the source chain as proof of intent to bridge assets.
- **Token Unlocking by Admin**: Admin can unlock/mint equivalent tokens on the destination chain.
- **Nonce Verification**: Prevents double-spending or replay attacks using nonce tracking.
- **Event Logging**: Emits logs for tracking token lock/unlock activities.

## üî≠ Future Scope
- Integration with ERC20 token support.
- Decentralized validator set for signature-based unlock verification.
- UI/UX frontend for easier user interactions.
- ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) or Light Client-based verification.
- Integration with L2 networks and major blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana).

**Note:** This is a simplified simulation of a bridge system. In real implementations, validator signatures, proof systems, and security audits are essential.
